# knn-classification-application
This project is my first machine learning application that consists of classifying if a worker earns more or less than 50.000 USD yearly, given multiple variables like gender, education, occupation, age, etc. I've chosen the KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) algorithm to achieve that.
